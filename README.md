# Library-Management

After the Corona virus spread, many stores and services have been converted to 
online 
services, e.g. education, book stores, libraries and movie rentals. One of your 
relatives, Zeinab, works at the local library that can lend books to local residents in 
the neighborhood. The local library decided to provide its services online and asked 
Zeinab to talk you into creating the software for their online library. She needs your 
help! 
Write a library management system using Golang to help Zeinab, knowing the 
following: 
1. Every book has the following data: id, title, publication date, author, genre, 
publisher and language. 
2. Every local reader has the following data: id, name, gender, birthday, height, 
weight and employment. 
3. Librarians need a client-side application (CLI) to communicate with the server. 
4. Because the library budget is so low, you 
cannot afford a database to store the data, but you will use text files to store data and 
retrieve them, instead. In addition, we'll have two 
servers only. one main server and the other is a backup server that should kick-start 
when the main server is down. 
5. As a librarian, you should be able to perform the following operations on readers: 
1. add a reader, 
2. remove a reader, 
3. search for a reader by id or name, 
4. get readers info 
6. As a librarian, you should be able to perform the following operations on books: 
1. add a book, 
2. search for a book by id or name,  
3. load books info, 
4. save books info, 
5. sort books by title, and 
6. sort by publication date 
Develop a Golang project to help Zeinab with her problem.
